# Contributing to TrustLink

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers everything you need to go from zero to a merged PR.

## Local Development Setup

TrustLink uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to enforce formatting and linting before every commit.

**Install the hooks once after cloning:**

```bash
pip install pre-commit   # or: brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

After that, every `git commit` automatically runs:

| Hook | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `cargo fmt --all -- --check` | Rust formatting (Rustfmt) |
| `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` | Rust lints (Clippy) |
| `check-yaml` | Valid YAML syntax |
| `end-of-file-fixer` | Files end with a newline |
| `trailing-whitespace` | No trailing spaces |

If a hook fails the commit is blocked. Fix the reported issues and `git commit` again.

**Run hooks manually at any time:**

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files   # check everything
pre-commit run cargo-fmt     # check one hook by id
```

## New to Stellar or Soroban?

Before diving in, read [docs/stellar-concepts.md](docs/stellar-concepts.md) for a beginner-friendly explanation of ledger timestamps, storage TTL, `require_auth`, and the WASM deployment model — concepts that come up throughout the codebase.

## Prerequisites

| Tool          | Version                            | Install                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Rust          | stable (see `rust-toolchain.toml`) | https://rustup.rs                          |
| wasm32 target | —                                  | `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` |
| Soroban CLI   | latest                             | `cargo install --locked soroban-cli`       |

Verify your setup:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
soroban --version
rustup target list --installed | grep wasm32
```

## Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TrustLink.git
cd TrustLink

# 2. Install the wasm target (rust-toolchain.toml handles the Rust version)
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# 3. Confirm the project compiles
cargo check
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit and integration tests
cargo test

# Or via make
make test
```

All tests must pass before submitting a PR.

## Local Stellar Development Workflow

Use a local Stellar Quickstart node when iterating on deployment and invoke flows to avoid testnet rate limits.

### 1. Start local network

```bash
docker compose up -d
# or: docker-compose up -d
```

This starts the `stellar/quickstart` standalone network from [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

### 2. Deploy and initialize locally

```bash
make local-deploy
```

What this does:

- Builds the contract WASM.
- Ensures local Soroban network + identity are configured.
- Funds the local identity via Friendbot.
- Deploys the contract.
- Invokes `initialize`.
- Writes the deployed contract ID to `.local.contract-id`.

### 3. Local RPC endpoint

Use this RPC URL for local calls and scripts:

```text
http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc
```

Default local network values used by `scripts/setup_local.sh`:

- Network name: `local`
- Network passphrase: `Standalone Network ; February 2017`

### 4. Stop local network

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Building the Contract

```bash
# Debug build
make build

# Optimized release build (requires soroban-cli)
make optimize
```

## Code Style

This project enforces formatting and lint rules in CI.

```bash
# Format code (must be clean before committing)
make fmt        # or: cargo fmt

# Run linter — zero warnings allowed
make clippy     # or: cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Run both before every commit.

## Commit Message Conventions

This project uses **Conventional Commits** to enable automated versioning and changelog generation. Every commit message must follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Type

**Required.** Must be one of:

| Type | Purpose | Semver Impact |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `feat` | A new feature | Minor (0.x.0) |
| `fix` | A bug fix | Patch (0.0.x) |
| `docs` | Documentation only | None |
| `test` | Tests only | None |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring (no feature/fix) | None |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | Patch (0.0.x) |
| `chore` | Build, CI, dependencies | None |

### Scope

**Optional.** Narrow the change to a specific area:

- `storage` — storage layer changes
- `validation` — authorization/validation logic
- `events` — event emission
- `indexer` — off-chain indexer
- `sdk` — TypeScript SDK
- `ci` — CI/CD workflows
- `docs` — documentation

Examples: `feat(storage)`, `fix(validation)`, `docs(indexer)`

### Subject

**Required.** Short description (50 chars max):

- Start with lowercase
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "adds" or "added")
- No period at the end
- Be specific: ✅ "add fee collection to attestation creation" vs ❌ "update code"

### Body

**Optional.** Explain *why* the change was made (not *what* — that's in the subject):

```
feat(storage): add dual indexing for subject and issuer lookups

The previous single index on subject made issuer-based queries O(n).
This adds a parallel index on issuer to enable fast lookups in both
directions. Queries now complete in O(log n) time.
```

### Footer

**Optional.** Reference issues or breaking changes:

```
Closes #42
Closes #99

BREAKING CHANGE: removed the `get_all_attestations` function
```

### Examples

**Good commits:**

```
feat(storage): add dual indexing for subject and issuer lookups
```

```
fix(validation): reject attestations with valid_from in the past

Previously, valid_from was only checked against the current time.
Now we also reject any valid_from that is before the current ledger
timestamp, preventing backdated attestations.

Closes #123
```

```
docs: update deployment guide with testnet contract IDs
```

```
test(events): add test for audit log append-only property
```

```
refactor: extract fee calculation into separate function
```

**Bad commits:**

```
❌ Updated stuff
❌ Fix bug
❌ feat: Add new feature.
❌ FEAT: ADD FEATURE
❌ feat(storage): added dual indexing
```

### Automated Release Process

When you merge commits to `main`:

1. **Release Please** reads your commit messages
2. Determines the next version (major.minor.patch) based on commit types
3. Creates a Release PR that:
   - Updates `Cargo.toml` version
   - Generates `CHANGELOG.md` from commits
   - Groups commits by type (Features, Bug Fixes, etc.)
4. When the Release PR is merged:
   - A GitHub Release is created with the tag
   - WASM artifacts are built and attached automatically

**Example:** If you merge `feat: ...` and `fix: ...` commits, the next release will be a **minor version bump** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0).

## PR Process

1. **Branch** off `main` with a descriptive name:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix
   ```

2. **Commit** with clear messages following [Conventional Commits](#commit-message-conventions).

3. **Before pushing**, make sure:

   - [ ] `cargo test` passes
   - [ ] `cargo fmt -- --check` is clean
   - [ ] `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` is clean
   - [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format

4. **Open a PR** against `main`. Include:

   - What the change does and why
   - Any relevant issue numbers (`Closes #123`)
   - Notes for reviewers if the change is non-obvious

5. **Commit validation**: The PR title must follow Conventional Commits format. This is checked automatically by CI.

6. **Review**: at least one approval is required before merging. Address all review comments; force-push to the same branch to update the PR.

7. **Merge**: Use "Squash and merge" or "Create a merge commit" (not "Rebase and merge") to preserve commit history for changelog generation.

## Reporting Issues

Open a GitHub issue with:

- A clear description of the problem or feature request
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Expected vs actual behaviour
